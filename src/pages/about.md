We all want to live our best life.

We want to mean something. To have an impact. To find peace and joy.

Escape The Pod is a mission to escape the cog of employment. To escape from the former "protective container or housing" you were trapped in.

To realize that if you are not living your dreams then you are only helping someone else live theirs. We want both. **You** to live your dreams **and** helping others live theirs.

I once heard someone call my cubicle a pod (when I was an employee for a large company). It stuck. Maybe you're not working in one of those pods but you feel trapped in a different way.

We invite you to join our **E**ntrepreneur **S**uccess **C**ommunity and to Escape The Pod.
